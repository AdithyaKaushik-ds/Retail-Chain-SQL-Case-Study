🛒 Retail Chain SQL Case Study: E-commerce Insights from Brazil

This case study involves in-depth SQL-based analysis of a major e-commerce retailer's operations in Brazil, using a dataset containing 100,000 customer orders placed between 2016 and 2018. The project focuses on uncovering business insights from order, payment, freight, customer, and product data using BigQuery.

📌 Objectives
Perform exploratory and trend analysis on orders and customer behavior.

Derive state-wise and monthly sales insights.

Evaluate operational metrics like delivery times and freight costs.

Analyze payment behavior and methods.

🔍 Key Analyses Conducted
Temporal Trends: Identified annual growth and monthly seasonality in orders; high activity during Feb–Mar (Brazilian Carnival).

Geographic Insights: São Paulo (SP) consistently had the highest order volume, customer base, and freight costs.

Operational Efficiency:

Most deliveries occurred within estimated time.

Certain states showed consistently faster-than-expected deliveries.

Economic Metrics:

Analyzed order value and freight cost averages across states.

Tracked year-over-year increase in total order cost (~Jan–Aug).

Payment Patterns:

Credit card was the most preferred method.

📊 Recommendations
Extend successful strategies from top-performing states like SP to others.

Introduce promotions during low-demand months (e.g., Sep–Oct).

Target afternoon and night hours with campaigns, as they reflect peak order times.

Offer credit card-related discounts or cashback to boost transactions.
